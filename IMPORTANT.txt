The text in the final copy of the book requires three updates. Of the three, two
are minor but one requires a replacement for the Chapter 10 section
"Searching Tables".

You can get the revised section along with other two updates by registering
your book. Use the URL below to complete registration. After doing so you will
be able to download the Companion. The Sample code on GitHub incorporates all
the changes. Without the Companion, the code from "Searching Tables" will not
match the Sample code in the repository.
